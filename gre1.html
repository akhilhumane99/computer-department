<p><big><b>About</b></big></p>
<p>The Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) is a standardized test that is an admissions requirement for most graduate schools in the United States.[7] The GRE is owned and administered by Educational Testing Service (ETS).[8] The test was established in 1936 by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.[9]
  </p><p>
    According to ETS, the GRE aims to measure verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, analytical writing, and critical thinking skills that have been acquired over a long period of learning. The content of the GRE consists of certain specific algebra, geometry, arithmetic, and vocabulary. The GRE General Test is offered as a computer-based exam administered at Prometric testing centers. In the graduate school admissions process, the level of emphasis that is placed upon GRE scores varies widely between schools and departments within schools. The importance of a GRE score can range from being a mere admission formality to an important selection factor.

The GRE was significantly overhauled in August 2011, resulting in an exam that is not adaptive on a question-by-question basis, but rather by section, so that the performance on the first verbal and math sections determine the difficulty of the second sections presented. Overall, the test retained the sections and many of the question types from its predecessor, but the scoring scale was changed to a 130 to 170 scale (from a 200 to 800 scale)

The cost to take the test is US$205,[5] although ETS will reduce the fee under certain circumstances.[6] They also promote financial aid to those GRE applicants who prove economic hardship.[11] ETS does not release scores that are older than 5 years, although graduate program policies on the acceptance of scores older than 5 years will vary.

<h3>History</h3>
The Graduate Record Examinations was "initiated in 1936 as a joint experiment in higher education by the graduate school deans of four eastern universities and the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching."[9]
<br>
The first universities to experiment the test on their students were Harvard University, Yale University, Princeton University and Columbia University.[12] The University of Wisconsin was the first public university to ask their students to take the test in 1938.[13] It was first given to students at the University of Iowa in 1940, where it was analysed by psychologist Dewey Stuit.[12] It was first taken by students at Texas Tech University in 1942.[14] In 1943, it was taken by students at Michigan State University, where it was analyzed by Paul Dressel.[15] It was taken by over 45,000 students applying to 500 colleges in 1948.[9]

<h3>Structure</h3>
The computer-based GRE General Test consists of six sections. The first section is always the analytical writing section involving separately timed issue and argument tasks. The next five sections consist of two verbal reasoning sections, two quantitative reasoning sections, and either an experimental or research section. These five sections may occur in any order. The experimental section does not count towards the final score but is not distinguished from the scored sections. Unlike the computer adaptive test before August 2011, the GRE General Test is a multistage test, where the examinee's performance on earlier sections determines the difficulty of subsequent sections. This format allows the examined person to freely move back and forth between questions within each section, and the testing software allows the user to "mark" questions within each section for later review if time remains. The entire testing procedure lasts about 3 hours 45 minutes.[16][17] One-minute breaks are offered after each section and a 10-minute break after the third section.
<br>
The paper-based GRE General Test also consists of six sections. The analytical writing is split up into two sections, one section for each issue and argument task. The next four sections consist of two verbal and two quantitative sections in varying order. There is no experimental section on the paper-based test. This version is only available in areas where the computer-based version is unavailable.

<h3>Verbal Section</h3>
The computer-based verbal sections assess reading comprehension, critical reasoning, and vocabulary usage. The verbal test is scored on a scale of 130–170, in 1-point increments. (Before August 2011, the scale was 200–800, in 10-point increments.) In a typical examination, each verbal section consists of 20 questions to be completed in 30 minutes.[16] Each verbal section consists of about 6 text completion, 4 sentence equivalence, and 10 critical reading questions. The changes in 2011 include a reduced emphasis on rote vocabulary knowledge and the elimination of antonyms and analogies. Text completion items have replaced sentence completions and new reading question types allowing for the selection of multiple answers were added.

<h3>Quantitaive Section</h3>
The computer-based quantitative sections assess basic high school level mathematical knowledge and reasoning skills. The quantitative test is scored on a scale of 130–170, in 1-point increments (Before August 2011 the scale was 200–800, in 10-point increments). In a typical examination, each quantitative section consists of 20 questions to be completed in 35 minutes.[16] Each quantitative section consists of about 8 quantitative comparisons, 9 problem solving items, and 3 data interpretation questions. The changes in 2011 include the addition of numeric entry items requiring the examinee to fill in the blank and multiple-choice items requiring the examinee to select multiple correct responses.[18]
