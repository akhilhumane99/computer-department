    <br>
    you have to go after it with a club"

    <br>Who hasn’t marveled at the celestial wonders and experienced a sense of awe at being a part of such an infinite expanse? Since its foundation in 2004, the CoEP Astronomy club seeks to build on this fascination and brings innovation and passion to its vision of spreading the awareness and knowledge of astronomy and space sciences to the students.
   <br>The CoEP Astronomy club, an ambitious team driven by amateur astronomers, has managed to conjure up a lot of interest amongst students in the science of stargazing.
<br><br>
Integrating technical skill with astronomical science, the club has initiated many projects, some of which being the construction of one of India’s largest amateur built telescope – a 12” Newtonian reflector, construction of mobile, inflatable planetarium dome, etc.
<br><br>
The club strives to quench a student’s thirst for astronomy by organizing various exciting events such as Star Party (a fun-filled night of star-gazing), Planetarium visits, Quiztronomy (a quiz to test people’s knowledge on everything seen beyond the night sky), Telescope building and handling sessions (telescope – every astronomers weapon), and many more.
<br><br>The club is also looking forward to publish its Newsletter from the academic year 2014-15 in order to promote righteous information about Astronomy
 and related science.
 <br><br>In addition to this, the club in association with the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics, Pune (IUCAA) organizes the event StareWay to Heaven during MindSpark with an aim to bring astronomy to the masses. Within this, a mobile planetarium is set up in the college, where the night sky is simulated and the people are introduced to various constellations and stars.
