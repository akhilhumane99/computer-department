<h2>" You can't wait for inspiration
<br>
you have to go after it with a club"
</h2></center>
<p>
<br><br>Society of Women Engineers (SWE) is an international, non-profit educational service organization dedicated to making known the need for women engineers and encouraging young women to consider an engineering education.
<br><br>COEP SWE Affiliate aims to provide members with the ideal engineering experience through networking and professional development events, personality development workshops, field visits and numerous inspiring keynote lectures by successful women across the globe.
<br>Two years ago, we represented COEP at the WE Local Conference 2017 held at Hyatt Regency, Pune. We also collaborated with Oracle to organize a personality development and CV building workshop for all the young girls. In our effort to collaborate with the international community, we hosted a group of University of Michigan SWE students at our campus which provided us with opportunities to get cultural and social exposure.

<br><br>Last year, we hosted Dr. Mrs. Anima Sabale, a NASA astrophysicist to interact with us at COEP. We also conducted a CV writing workshop and a field trip in collaboration with Eaton. We have established the first Women's Day celebrations at COEP in 2018 in collaboration with Debate CLub and COEP Literary Society and held a Women In Data Science programme.
<br>Since this club is its third year, there is immense scope and potential for all the girls out there to use this opportunity to get associated with this international organization. This will provide immense benefits such as scholarships, job opportunities, workshops aimed at technical and non-technical skills.
